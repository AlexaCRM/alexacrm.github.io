> **Note:** Dataverse Integration has been renamed to **DataPress**. All references will be gradually updated.

Use **Twig templates** to build custom layouts and display Dataverse data directly inside WordPress.  
DataPress extends Twig with additional objects, helpers, and filters to simplify working with Dataverse entities, metadata, user binding, and environment settings.

## What You Can Do with Twig in DataPress

- Render Dataverse records in custom layouts.
- Access page-bound records and current user data.
- Query any Dataverse table by logical name and GUID.
- Read site, user, and request context.
- Format dates, currencies, durations, choices, and lookup values.
- Build dynamic forms (including multiple‑choice fields).
