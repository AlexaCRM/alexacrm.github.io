We use [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) for syntax highlighting. 

It does not affect the behavior of the plugin.
However, if you encounter unexpected behavior:
1. Navigate to the Dataverse Admin Area.
2. Go to Settings -> Advanced settings.
3. Enable the **ICDS_DISABLE_MONACO** option.
