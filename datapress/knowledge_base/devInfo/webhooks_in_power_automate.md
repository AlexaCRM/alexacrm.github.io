# Webhooks in Power Automate

Webhooks are a powerful way to trigger Power Automate flows from external systems in real time. This guide walks you through how to configure and use them effectively.

## ðŸ”— Setting Up a Webhook Trigger

Follow these steps to set up a webhook using the **"When an HTTP request is received"** trigger:

1. **Create a New Flow**
   - Go to Power Automate and select **Create â†’ Instant cloud flow**.
   - Choose **"When an HTTP request is received"** as the trigger.

2. **Define the JSON Schema**
   - Click **Use sample payload to generate schema**.
   - Paste a sample JSON payload that your external service will send.

3. **Add Actions**
   - Use the output from the trigger to add further actionsâ€”such as sending an email, storing data, or calling another API.

4. **Save and Copy the URL**
   - Save the flow to generate a unique webhook URL.
   - Use this URL in your external system to send HTTP POST requests.

5. **Test the Webhook**
   - Use Postman, curl, or your external system to send a test request.
   - The flow should trigger and execute your defined steps.

6. **Register the Webhook Source**

**Option A: Using DataPress Admin Interface**:

- Open the DataPress Admin Area.
- Create a new webhook following this [instruction](/knowledge-base/webhooks/#configuring-webhooks).
- Paste the Power Automate URL from Step 4 into the Webhook URL field.

**Option B: Using Power Automate HTTP Webhook Trigger Flow**:

Instead of configuring the webhook in DataPress, you can create another flow using the HTTP Webhook trigger. Use the settings below:
- Subscribe Method: POST
- Subscribe URI: https://your-website.com/wp-json/integration-cds/v1/webhooks
- Subscribe Body: Follow the same [instruction](/knowledge-base/webhooks/#configuring-webhooks)
- Subscribe - Authentication: Username and password (basic authentication)

- Create a flow using the **"When an HTTP request is received"** trigger.
- Define a JSON schema based on expected data.
- Build out actions within the flow.
- Copy the generated HTTP POST endpoint.
- Test it using tools or actual services.
