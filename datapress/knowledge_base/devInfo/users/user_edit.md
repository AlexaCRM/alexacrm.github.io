If a page is bound to a contact table then passing contact identifier in the query string will set the `binding` object and allow record editing using, for example, a Gravity form that relies on the record binding.

Allowing user to edit their own Dataverse record is slightly different. We already know the contact id and shouldnâ€™t pass it via the query string.

This can be used, for example, to build a page that uses Gravity Form for user profile editing.

```php
// Let's assume that profile page ID is 42 
add_filter( 'integration-cds/binding/bound-record', function( $record, $post ) {     
    if ( $post->ID !== 42 ) {
      return $record;     
    }

    return \AlexaCRM\Nextgen\UserService\UserService::instance()->getBoundRecord();
}, 10, 2 );
```
