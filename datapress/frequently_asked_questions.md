## What is a Dataverse instance?

A Dataverse instance is a cloud-based database environment provided by Microsoft Dataverse. It allows you to securely store and manage data used by business applications. Here are some key points about a Dataverse instance:

**Data Storage**: Data is stored in tables, which are collections of rows and columns. You can use standard tables provided by Dataverse or create custom tables to fit your specific needs1.
**Security**: Dataverse uses Azure Active Directory for identity and access management, ensuring that only authorized users can access the data2.
**Integration**: It integrates seamlessly with other Microsoft services like Dynamics 365, Power Apps, and Power Automate, allowing you to build comprehensive business solutions3.
Customization: You can customize tables, columns, and relationships to reflect your business processes and rules4.
