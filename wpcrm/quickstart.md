Once the plugin is activated, go to **Dynamics 365 > Connection** and configure the connection to your Dynamics 365 instance. Choose the appropriate deployment type, *CRM Online* or *On-premises.* Enter the URL of your Dynamics 365 organization, and specify user name and password to access your Dynamics 365 instance.
