Once the plugin is activated, go to **Dynamics 365 > Connection** and configure the connection to your Dynamics 365 instance. Choose either 'CRM Online' or 'On-premises' deployment type depending on the type of deployment of your application. Enter URL address of your Dynamics 365 application, user name and password to grant access to your Dynamics 365 instance for the plugin.
