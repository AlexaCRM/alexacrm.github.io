Nothing gets between your web site and your CRM. No more iframes, no more third-party services, no more moving parts. Built using [CRM Toolkit for PHP](github.com/AlexaCRM/php-crm-toolkit), the plugin connects directly to Dynamics CRM without the need to add anything else.

This documentation assumes that you're using both free and premium plugins. Features available to premium users only are marked appropriately.
