title: Installation
---

Using the WordPress Admin to install plugins is the most straightforward option, as it handles the file transfer without you needing to leave the Web browser.

## Install WordPress CRM (preferred)

1. **Download** the plugin (.zip file).
2. **Log in** to your WordPress Admin panel.
3. In your Admin, go to menu **Plugins > Add New.**
4. **Select** the tab "Upload plugin".
5. **Upload** the WordPress CRM Plugin.zip file you just downloaded.
6. **Activate** the plugin.

A new settings section called "Dynamics CRM" will appear in the Admin panel.

## FTP Setup (the old way)

It is possible at this stage that you'll be taken to a page requesting FTP details of your web server. This happens if you've not installed a plugin on this particular installation of WordPress. If that's the case, fill in your details to complete installation.

1. Download the plugin (.zip file).
2. Unzip the folder and Upload `wordpress-crm` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the "Plugin" menu in WordPress.

A new settings section called "Dynamics CRM" will appear in the Admin panel.
